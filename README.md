# PapersWithCode Implementations

This repository contains implementations of research papers that I have read, recreated from scratch using PyTorch.
+ Also, folders in the repo contain the code of respective deep learning arch and the article papers.
+ The purpose of this repo is that take note
+ The purpose of this repo is that to collect the papers that a cs student should read on deep learning, along the their code.

## Table Of Content (The papers i have completed)

+ Attention is All You Need
+ LeNet
+ ResNet
+ Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

#### Required Packages (I use Python3.10 but the codes are available to run at each python version)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv #create a virtual enviroment
source venv/bin/activate #
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
